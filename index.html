<H1>dvdauthor HOWTO</H1>

<P>
  <A HREF="http://dvdauthor.sourceforge.net/">dvdauthor</A> is a
  command line-based DVD authoring program.
  There are many DVD authoring programs with a graphical interface,
  but if you, like me, prefer the simplicity and predictability of the
  command line -- or need to author lots of DVDs and would benefit
  from being able to use automated scripts -- dvdauthor is the right
  tool for you.

<H2><A NAME="overview">DVD authoring overview</A></H2>
<P>
  dvdauthor is <EM>not</EM> a complete DVD authoring solution.
  It performs one specific operation: take a set of audio and video
  track files and build with them a directory tree compliant with the
  DVD specification (from now on we'll call this "the DVD tree").
  This is only one step in the procedure of going from the camera to
  the finished DVD.
  The other steps must be performed by other programs.
<P>
  The procedure could be summarized as follows:
</P>
<OL>
  <LI>Create the raw video and audio footage.
  <LI>Cut and edit the tracks that you want to put into the DVD.
  <LI> Build the DVD tree.
  <LI>Build the DVD image file in ISO format.
  <LI>Burn the image to an actual disc.
</OL>
<P>
  Step 3 is what dvdauthor does and is the main subject of this
  HOWTO.
  But before entering that, I'll also say a few words on the other
  steps.
  Since dvdauthor is a command line tool, I'm describing command line
  tools for those too, but there are also graphical equivalents if you
  prefer to use them.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="video">Creating video</A></H3>
<P>
  I haven't much to say on this -- if you're filming a live action
  scene, any modern video recording equipment will save the recorded
  footage to digital audio and video files ready for the next step
  (the audio may be included into the video files or saved as separate
  files).
  If you're making an animation, there are many different methods and
  tools that you could use, but that is beyond the scope of this HOWTO
  (and well beyond my expertise).
  In any case, you'll still have to convert your animation into audio
  and video files.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="tracks">Editing tracks</A></H3>
<P>
  The most popular command line video editor
  is <A HREF="https://ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</A>.
  That's a powerful program that should be good for most purposes.
<P>
  I don't mean (and don't know enough) to write also a tutorial on
  ffmpeg.
  I'm just writing down the commands that I used to set up the video
  tracks that I needed to build my DVDs.
  Those may or may not be enough for your needs as well.
<P>
  In typical usage of ffmpeg, you'll specify one or more input files,
  one output file, and any number of command line options by which you
  tell ffmpeg what kind of processing to do.
  Every input file must be preceded by a <TT>-i</TT> switch.
  The encoding of each input and output file will generally be
  inferred from the file's extension.
  For example:
</P>
<PRE>
  ffmpeg -i input.mp4 output.mpg
</PRE>
<P>
  This will read an MPEG-4 video file and convert it to MPEG-2.
<P>
  To cut a section of a video, run this:
</P>
<PRE>
  ffmpeg -ss 0:02:00 -i video.mp4 -t 0:03:00 -c copy track.mp4
</PRE>
<P>
  The <TT>-ss 0:02:00</TT> argument tells ffmpeg to skip 2 minutes of
  video, while the <TT>-t 0:03:00</TT> tells it to cut a 3-minutes
  long section.
  That is, the track that you're cutting starts at 2 minutes and ends
  at 5 minutes since the beginning of the input video.
  The <TT>-c copy</TT> tells ffmpeg to not recode the video (which it
  does by default) but simply copy from the original.
<P>
  To recode a video into the format required by DVD, run this:
</P>
<PRE>
  ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -target pal-dvd -aspect 16:9 video.mpg
</PRE>
<P>
  If you live in a country where NTSC is the TV standard,
  replace <TT>pal-dvd</TT> with <TT>ntsc-dvd</TT>.
  That's most of America and a few Asian and Oceanian countries; the
  rest of the world uses PAL.
<P>
  The <TT>-aspect</TT> argument sets the aspect ratio, that is, the
  ratio between width and height of the video frame.
  DVD videos can have either 4:3 or 16:9 aspect ratio.
  If that doesn't match the dimensions of the screen on which the DVD
  is played, either black strips will be displayed or the video will
  be cropped.
  Most recent screens have 16:9 aspect ratio, so I suggest to use
  that.
<P>
  To force a lower bitrate than the default, so that you can fit a
  longer video in the size of a DVD (at the price of some degradation
  in the image quality), add the <TT>-b</TT> option:
</P>
<PRE>
  ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -target pal-dvd -aspect 16:9 -b 4M video.mpg
</PRE>
<P>
  <TT>4M</TT> means 4 Mb/s (Megabits per second).
  You may also specify that as <TT>4000k</TT> or <TT>4000000</TT> (it
  goes by multiples of 1000, not 1024).
  According to my tests the default bitrate is 6 Mb/s.
  That's the nominal bitrate; the actual rate can be somewhat
  different.
<P>
  You can of course combine different options, for example this will
  cut a section and recode into DVD format at the same time:
</P>
<PRE>
  ffmpeg -ss 0:02:00 -i video.mp4 -target pal-dvd -aspect 16:9 -t 0:03:00 video.mpg
</PRE>
<P>
  If you're running your video through multiple editing steps, I
  recommend to keep the original resolution during all the
  intermediate steps and only do the <TT>-target pal-dvd</TT> in the
  final step.
  This will minimize data loss.
<P>
  To build a video from a sequence of images (each image will be a
  frame), run this:
</P>
<PRE>
  ffmpeg -i image%03d.png -target pal-dvd -aspect 16:9 video.mpg
</PRE>
<P>
  The argument <TT>-i image%03d.png</TT> tells ffmpeg to look for a
  sequence of images called
  <TT>image001.png</TT>, <TT>image002.png</TT>, <TT>image003.png</TT>,
  and so on.
  The <TT>%03d</TT> substring means that the numeric part of the
  filename is a 3-digit number padded with zeros.
  If the files were called
  <TT>image01.png</TT>, <TT>image02.png</TT>, <TT>image03.png</TT>,
  etc., the substring would be <TT>%02d</TT>.
  (If you are familiar with the C language, you'll recognize the
  printf-style syntax.)
<P>
  Having used <TT>-target pal-dvd</TT>, the generated video has 25
  frames per second (with <TT>-target ntsc-dvd</TT> they would be
  29.97).
  You should take that into account when creating the sequence.
<P>
  If you want the video to have an associated audio, you can add an
  input audio file on the command line:
</P>
<PRE>
  ffmpeg -i image%03d.png -i audio.mp3 -target pal-dvd -aspect 16:9 video.mpg
</PRE>
<P>
  If you don't, the video will be silent.
<P>
  You ought to know that DVDs have non-square pixels: the video
  resolution of PAL (720x576 pixels) and NTSC (720x480) match neither
  the 4:3 nor the 16:9 aspect ratio (they are, respectively, 5:4 and
  3:2).
  So the images that you see when watching the DVD will be stretched
  or shrinked with respect to what you see when looking at the
  original image files on the computer screen.
  In order to handle that correctly and avoid unwanted distortions, I
  suggest to create the images with the final aspect ratio with which
  the DVD will be played (as written above, I recommend 16:9).
  ffmpeg will rescale them automatically.
<P>
  To build a static video from a single image, run this:
</P>
<PRE>
  ffmpeg -loop 1 -i image.png -target pal-dvd -aspect 16:9 -t 0:10 video.mpg
</PRE>
<P>
  The <TT>-t 0:10</TT> tells ffmpeg to create a 10-seconds video.
  With a fixed image as input, it is necessary to specify the
  duration, otherwise ffmpeg couldn't know when to stop.
  As above, you may add an input audio file.
  A typical application for a static video would be the DVD menu
  (although you may want to display an animated scene there as well).
<P>
  To overlay an image over a video, run this:
</P>
<PRE>
  ffmpeg -i video.mpg -i image.png -filter_complex "[0:v][1:v] overlay" -target pal-dvd video+image.mpg
</PRE>
<P>
  The image must have a transparent background or else it will
  hide <EM>all</EM> the video.
  ffmpeg accepts all the most common image encoding formats, but as
  you need transparency, you must use a format that supports it.
  Most notably, that excludes JPEG.
<P>
  To overlay the image only for the first 5 seconds, run this:
</P>
<PRE>
  ffmpeg -i video.mpg -i image.png -filter_complex "[0:v][1:v] overlay=0:0:enable='between(t,0,5)'" -target pal-dvd video+image.mpg
</PRE>
<P>
  You may use that for displaying a title at the start of a track.
  Of course if you want to display it for more or less than 5 seconds
  you can change the number.
  The <TT>0:0</TT> tells ffmpeg where to position the image (if you
  specify numbers different from 0, the image will be offset).
  It is apparently required for ffmpeg to read correctly
  the <TT>enable</TT> part.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="images">Building ISO images</A></H3>
<P>
  An ISO image file is the preferred format for data to be written on
  a CD or DVD disc.
  It's an archive that may contain any number of files and
  directories.
  In the case of a Video DVD, the contents must be a valid DVD tree,
  such as those created by dvdauthor.
<P>
  The command line tool for building ISO images is genisoimage.
  There is still around some older documentation that mentions
  mkisofs; that was the predecessor of genisoimage.
  The latter is what you'll find in any recent GNU/Linux
  distribution.
<P>
The command line to build a DVD Video ISO image is this:
</P>
<PRE>
  genisoimage -v -dvd-video -V "example01" -o example01.iso example01
</PRE>
<P>
  The <TT>-v</TT> argument means "verbose".
  It tells genisoimage to display progress information while creating
  the ISO image.
  If you don't want that, you can omit it.
  The <TT>-dvd-video</TT> argument tells genisoimage to make sure that
  the generated ISO image is compliant with the DVD Video
  specification, otherwise your DVD player might not be able to read
  it.
  The <TT>-V "example01"</TT> sets the volume label of the image.
  This is a string where you can put a label that identifies the image
  contents.
  It can be up to 32 characters long.
  The quotes are required if it contains spaces or special characters,
  otherwise they may be omitted.
  The <TT>-o</TT> switch lets you specify the name of the image file.
  The last argument is the name of the directory whose contents will
  be copied into the image.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="discs">Burning DVD discs</A></H3>
<P>
  The command line tool for burning CDs and DVDs is wodim (Write
  Optical DIsk Media).
  It is also the successor of an older program.
  I think it was called cdrecord, but it's been a few years so I am
  not sure I remember correctly.
<P>
  The command line for writing a disc is this:
</P>
<PRE>
  wodim -v dev=/dev/sr0 image.iso
</PRE>
<P>
  The <TT>-v</TT> switch means "verbose".
  It tells wodim to display progress information while burning the
  disc.
  If you don't want that, you can omit it.
  The <TT>dev=/dev/sr0</TT> argument tells wodim the device name of
  the DVD burner.
  <TT>/dev/sr0</TT> is how it's called on my computer.
  On yours it may be different.
  If you don't know what it is and want to find out, insert a
  (non-blank) DVD into the drive and mount it, then run <TT>df</TT>
  and look for it in the output: the <TT>Filesystem</TT> column is
  where you'll find the device name.
  The last argument is the name of the ISO image to be written on the
  disc.
<P>
  If you want to burn the image on a rewritable disc (which is a good
  way to test your DVDs without throwing away a disc every time you
  get anything wrong), if it already contains data you must blank it
  first.
  To do that, run this:
</P>
<PRE>
  wodim -v dev=/dev/sr0 blank=fast
</PRE>
<P>
  I must say that on my computer, this works for CDs, but for DVDs it
  writes an error message and refuses to blank the disc.
  I couldn't find what the problem is.
  It may or may not work for you.
</P>

<H2><A NAME="installing">Installing dvdauthor</A></H2>
<P>
  dvdauthor should be available in any of the most common GNU/Linux
  distributions, thus it can be installed using the standard tools
  (aptitude on Debian and Ubuntu, yum on Fedora, etc.).
  In fact, it may even be already installed on your computer.
  It was on mine.
  I run Debian GNU/Linux with the Gnome desktop, and dvdauthor was
  pulled in as a dependency of brasero (Gnome CD/DVD burner).
</P>

<H2><A NAME="running">Running dvdauthor</A></H2>
<P>
  When I tried running dvdauthor, at first I couldn't make it work.
  It kept writing this message and then failing at some stage, leaving
  an incomplete DVD tree:
</P>
<PRE>
  INFO: no default video format, must explicitly specify NTSC or PAL
</PRE>
<P>
  (As I've already written above, NTSC is the TV standard in most of
  America and a few Asian and Oceanian countries; the rest of the
  world uses PAL.)
<P>
  I finally got rid of that by creating a configuration file that
  tells dvdauthor what my default video format is.
  This is how I did it:
</P>
<PRE>
  echo PAL > $HOME/.config/video_format
</PRE>
<P>
  Later, I discovered that another way is to set
  the <TT>VIDEO_FORMAT</TT> environment variable.
  If you're running bash as your command line shell, you can add this
  line to your <TT>$HOME/.bashrc</TT> file (otherwise, use the
  equivalent syntax and configuration file for your shell of choice):
</P>
<PRE>
  export VIDEO_FORMAT=PAL
</PRE>
<P>
  Do what you prefer.
<P>
  And now let's see how to actually use dvdauthor:
<P>
  You can tell it what to do either via command line arguments,
  or via a control file in XML format.
  The latter way is more flexible and configurable, or at least I
  didn't discover how to do the same things with the former.
  Anyway, I'll present a few examples of both.
<P>
  I'll start with a minimal example, then gradually add more
  features.
<P>
  All the files needed to try these examples on your computer can be
  downloaded from <A HREF="#files">the Files section</A> of this
  document.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="example1">Example 1</A></H3>
<P>
  The simplest DVD that you can build contains just one video track
  and no menu.
  When you insert the disc into the DVD reader, it starts playing the
  track and stops when it's finished.
<P>
  You can build it simply by typing these on the command line:
</P>
<PRE>
  dvdauthor -o example01 -t track01.mpg
  dvdauthor -o example01 -T
</PRE>
<P>
  The first line creates the DVD tree and writes the track there.
  The second creates the DVD's table of contents files.
<P>
  A DVD tree is a directory that contains two directories
  called <TT>AUDIO_TS</TT> and <TT>VIDEO_TS</TT>.
  If you're making a video DVD, <TT>AUDIO_TS</TT> will be empty
  and <TT>VIDEO_TS</TT> will contain all the relevant files (tracks
  etc.).
  If you're making an audio DVD, it'll be the opposite.
  (This HOWTO shows how to make video DVDs; I didn't investigate
  whether dvdauthor can build audio DVDs too.)
<P>
  The <TT>-o example01</TT> tells dvdauthor to write the DVD tree to a
  directory called <TT>example01</TT>; of course you can change the
  name to anything you like.
  The directory will be created if it doesn't exist.
  In fact, it is <EM>not</EM> recommended to run dvdauthor on an
  existing directory.
  If it exists as a leftover of a previous attempt, you should delete
  it using this command:
</P>
<PRE>
  dvddirdel -o example01
</PRE>
<P>
  dvddirdel is a utility distributed together with dvdauthor.
  The directory could also be deleted via the usual <TT>rm -rf</TT>
  command, however the dvdauthor documentation recommends using
  dvddirdel.
  In order to prevent accidentally deleting the wrong directory,
  dvddirdel checks for a valid DVD tree structure, and refuses to do
  anything if it doesn't find it.
  It also refuses to do anything if you forget the <TT>-o</TT> switch
  before the directory name (I got hit by this a few times).
<P>
  <TT>track01.mpg</TT> is, of course, the name of the video track
  file.
  Again, you can change it to anything you like.
  The sample file provided with this HOWTO (see <A HREF="#files">the
  Files section</A>) shows a simple clock ticking for 15 seconds, with
  a short sound (a "beep") at every move of the hand.
<P>
  After running the above commands, <TT>ls -R example01</TT> should
  give you this:
</P>
<PRE>
  example01:
  AUDIO_TS  VIDEO_TS

  example01/AUDIO_TS:

  example01/VIDEO_TS:
  VIDEO_TS.BUP  VIDEO_TS.IFO  VTS_01_0.BUP  VTS_01_0.IFO  VTS_01_1.VOB
</PRE>
<P>
  <TT>VTS_01_1.VOB</TT> contains the video track.
  If that is larger than 1 GB, it will be split into multiple files of
  (slightly less than) 1 GB each.
  The additional files will be
  called <TT>VTS_01_2.VOB</TT>, <TT>VTS_01_3.VOB</TT>, and so on.
  Usually there is also a file called <TT>VIDEO_TS.VOB</TT> containing
  the video track for the DVD menu.
  In this example there is no menu, so this file is missing.
  The other files contain other informations required by the DVD
  player; the <TT>*.BUP</TT> files are backup copies of
  the <TT>*.IFO</TT> files.
<P>
  If everything worked as expected, now you can run genisoimage to
  build the DVD image (see <A HREF="#images">above</A>), burn it to a
  disc (<A HREF="#discs">ditto</A>), and try it on your DVD reader.
  You may also download and try the prebuilt
  image <TT>example01.iso</TT> from <A HREF="#files">the Files
  section</A>.
  The files in your DVD tree should be byte-for-byte identical to
  those contained there.
<P>
  You can obtain the same result by running dvdauthor with this
  control file:
</P>
<PRE>
  &lt;dvdauthor dest="example01">
    &lt;vmgm />
    &lt;titleset>
      &lt;titles>
	&lt;pgc>
          &lt;vob file="track01.mpg" />
	&lt;/pgc>
      &lt;/titles>
    &lt;/titleset>
  &lt;/dvdauthor>
</PRE>
<P>
  The syntax to run dvdauthor with a control file is this:
</P>
<PRE>
  dvdauthor -x example01.xml
</PRE>
<P>
  The target directory is specified by the <TT>dest</TT> attribute in
  the control file.
  Alternatively, you can omit the attribute and specify the target
  directory on the command line via the <TT>-o</TT> switch.
  If you specify both, the command line argument takes precedence.
  Other command line switches (<TT>-t</TT>, <TT>-T</TT> etc.) can't be
  used together with <TT>-x</TT>.
<P>
  I assume that you have at least basic knowledge of XML -- what's a
  tag, what's an attribute, an so on.
  After all, we're well into the 21st century and XML should now be
  the format of choice for almost any kind of textual data.
<P>
  The <TT>&lt;vmgm></TT> tag contains the definition of the main menu
  of the DVD.
  In this example there is no menu, so the tag is empty; however it
  must be there.
  The <TT>&lt;titleset></TT> tag contains the definition of the DVD's
  titleset.
  A titleset is where a set of tracks and its associated material is
  stored.
  In the following we'll see more examples of things that can be put
  into a titleset.
  A DVD may also have more than one titleset; we'll see an example of
  that too.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="example2">Example 2</A></H3>
<P>
  Normally, DVDs are split into multiple "chapters", that is, track
  sections.
  That allows you to skip portions of the video and jump to specific
  points.
  In this example, there's still no menu, so you can't actually select
  a chapter when you insert the disc into the reader, but you can move
  forward and backward between chapters using the remote control.
<P>
  dvdauthor will create a DVD with multiple chapters if you specify
  multiple track files on the command line.
  Every track file will be a chapter.
  Simply write the file names one after another on the command line:
</P>
<PRE>
  dvdauthor -o example02 -t track01.mpg track02.mpg track03.mpg track04.mpg
  dvdauthor -o example02 -T
</PRE>
<P>
  In this example there are four chapters, but there can be any number
  up to 99.
  You can again download sample track files from <A HREF="#files">the Files
  section</A> (that holds also for all the following examples, but
  this is the last time I'm repeating it).
  The first file is the same used in the previous example.
  Together those tracks show a simple clock ticking for a full minute;
  each of them is a 15-seconds section.
  Some DVD players might pause for a fraction of a second between
  tracks.
<P>
  The control file that gives the same result is very similar to that
  in the previous example.
  Just add a <TT>&lt;vob></TT> tag for each track:
</P>
<PRE>
  &lt;dvdauthor dest="example02">
    &lt;vmgm />
    &lt;titleset>
      &lt;titles>
	&lt;pgc>
          &lt;vob file="track01.mpg" />
          &lt;vob file="track02.mpg" />
          &lt;vob file="track03.mpg" />
          &lt;vob file="track04.mpg" />
	&lt;/pgc>
      &lt;/titles>
    &lt;/titleset>
  &lt;/dvdauthor>
</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="example3">Example 3</A></H3>
<P>
  A more flexible way to split a DVD into multiple chapters is to tell
  dvdauthor explicitly at which time you want each chapter to begin.
  This can be done with the <TT>-c</TT> command line switch:
</P>
<PRE>
  dvdauthor -o example03 -t -c 0,0:10 track01.mpg -c 0:05 track02.mpg -c 0,0:10 track03.mpg -c 0:05 track04.mpg
  dvdauthor -o example03 -T
</PRE>
<P>
  Each <TT>-c</TT> switch is applied to the track file immediately
  following it.
  The time is counted from the beginning of the track -- <EM>not</EM>
  the beginning of the DVD.
  If any chapters are set explicitly, dvdauthor will <EM>not</EM>
  automatically start a new chapter with every track.
<P>
  So this DVD has six chapters: the first starts at the beginning of
  the first track -- this one must always be there and dvdauthor will
  set it even if you don't specify it.
  The second chapter starts after 10 seconds.
  The third starts 5 seconds into the second track, that is, 20
  seconds after the beginning of the DVD (this is assuming that you're
  using again my sample tracks, which are 15-seconds long).
  And a bit of math will show you that the fourth, fifth and sixth
  tracks start at 30, 40 and 50 seconds.
  In other words, this video is split into 10-seconds sections.
<P>
  In fact, when you play this DVD, you might notice that the chapters
  don't begin <EM>exactly</EM> every 10 seconds.
  That's because of how videos are encoded: for technical reasons it
  isn't possible to start playing at any time, but only at selected
  frames called P frames (P stands for "principal").
  The beginning of each chapter will be set as close as possible to
  the specified point.
<P>
  To do the same with a control file, you can add
  the <TT>chapters</TT> attribute to <TT>&lt;vob></TT> tags:

<P>
  Now we'll see how to create DVDs with menus.
<P>
  From now on, I'll use exclusively control files because I couldn't
  find how to create menus with command line arguments.
  The switch for doing that should be <TT>-m</TT> but I haven't been
  able to find the correct syntax.
  If you find it, I'd like to know.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="example4">Example 4</A></H3>
<P>
  This is the simplest example (except for the <TT>dest</TT>
  attribute, which may be omitted as explained in Example 1) of a
  control file that defines a menu:
</P>
<PRE>
  &lt;dvdauthor dest="example04">
    &lt;vmgm>
      &lt;menus>
	&lt;pgc>
          &lt;vob file="menu1.mpg" />

	&lt;/pgc>
      &lt;/titles>
    &lt;/titleset>
  &lt;/dvdauthor>
</PRE>
<P>
  It is, in fact, <EM>too</EM> simple.
  If you create a DVD from this, you'll find that after playing the
  menu, it just stops.
  There is no way to get to play the track!
</P>

<H3><A NAME="example5">Example 5</A></H3>
<P>
  To get past the menu, you must tell dvdauthor what to do when it's
  finished.
  This is how you can do that:
</P>
<PRE>
  &lt;dvdauthor dest="example05">
    &lt;vmgm>
      &lt;menus>
	&lt;pgc>
          &lt;vob file="menu1.mpg" />
          &lt;post>jump title 1;&lt;/post>
	&lt;/pgc>
      &lt;/menus>
    &lt;/vmgm>
    &lt;titleset>
      &lt;titles>
	&lt;pgc>
          &lt;vob file="track01.mpg" />
          &lt;post>call vmgm menu;&lt;/post>
	&lt;/pgc>
      &lt;/titles>
    &lt;/titleset>
  &lt;/dvdauthor>
</PRE>
<P>
  The <TT>&lt;post></TT> tag specifies an action to be performed after
  the tracks in the menu or title have been played.
  <TT>jump title 1;</TT> tells dvdauthor that after playing the menu,
  it must go to the first title of the DVD (a DVD might contain
  multiple titles; we'll see that later).
  That is, when the menu is finished the track will start.
<P>
  The second <TT>&lt;post></TT> tag specifies what to do after the
  track has been played too.
  <TT>call vmgm menu;</TT> tells dvdauthor to go back to play the
  menu.
  So this DVD will loop between the menu and the track until you stop
  it.
<P>
  What's the difference between <TT>jump</TT> and <TT>call</TT>?
  I'm not sure.
  It seems that <TT>jump</TT> can't be used at the end of a
  title, so <TT>call</TT> must be used there.
  In all other places <TT>jump</TT> seems to work.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="example6">Example 6</A></H3>
<P>
  The menu defined within a <TT>&lt;vmgm></TT> tag is the main menu of
  the DVD.
  But DVDs can have more than just one menu.
  Indeed, each titleset may have its own menu too.
<P>
  To define a titleset menu, just put the <TT>&lt;menus></TT> tag into
  the <TT>&lt;titleset></TT> tag:
</P>
<PRE>
  &lt;dvdauthor dest="example06">
    &lt;vmgm />
    &lt;titleset>
      &lt;menus>
	&lt;pgc>
          &lt;vob file="menu1.mpg" />
          &lt;post>jump title 1;&lt;/post>
	&lt;/pgc>
      &lt;/menus>
      &lt;titles>
	&lt;pgc>
          &lt;vob file="track01.mpg" />
          &lt;post>call menu;&lt;/post>
	&lt;/pgc>
      &lt;/titles>
    &lt;/titleset>
  &lt;/dvdauthor>
</PRE>
<P>
  In this example there is no main menu (empty <TT>&lt;vmgm></TT>
  tag).
  Thus the DVD will start playing directly from the titleset menu, and
  will loop between menu and track like the previous example.
  Note that the second <TT>&lt;post></TT> tag is slightly
  different here: <TT>call menu;</TT> (this titleset's menu) instead
  of <TT>call vmgm menu;</TT> (the main menu).
<P>
  What's the difference between main menu and titleset menu?
  For one, the "menu" button of my DVD player's remote control goes to
  the titleset menu.
  If there is only a main menu, pressing the button makes the player
  display an "invalid entry" message.
  There seems to be no way to go back to the main menu except via
  a <TT>&lt;post></TT> tag (which means that you must get to the end
  of the title first).
  I don't know whether that is true of all players.
<P>
  Another difference is that some actions can be called in one kind of
  menu and not in the other.
  For example, it seems that you can only jump to a specified chapter
  from the titleset menu -- from the main menu you can only start a
  title from the beginning.
  And when an action can be performed from both menus, the syntax may
  be different.
<P>
  I didn't find anywhere a complete documentation of what can or
  cannot be done.
  If you try doing something that isn't allowed, dvdauthor will exit
  and print an error message.
  In the following I'll show some examples that worked for me.
</P>

<H2><A NAME="spumux">spumux</A></H2>
<P>
  The menus we've seen in the previous examples are in fact no more
  than short tracks that play before other tracks, but don't let you
  select any actions.
  To build a "real" menu, one that actually lets you navigate the DVD,
  you must define buttons.
  For that purpose, with dvdauthor comes a tool called spumux.
<P>
  Like dvdauthor, spumux works with an XML control file, but the
  command line syntax is different.
  You must not prepend <TT>-o</TT> to the file name, and must feed the
  input and output file through I/O redirection:
</P>
<PRE>
  spumux control.xml < video.mpg > video-with-buttons.mpg
</PRE>
<P>
  Each button takes a rectangular area on the screen.
  When playing the DVD on your computer, you can activate the button
  by clicking there with the mouse; while on a DVD player, you can
  move between buttons and press them with the remote control.
<P>
  To add buttons to a video, you need three images.
  One shows the default appearance of the buttons, another shows the
  appearance of the buttons when they're being highlighted, and the
  third shows their appearance when they're pressed.
  Of course only one button can be highlighted or pressed at a time,
  but in those images you must draw them all highlighted or all
  pressed.
  When the video will be played and any button will be selected, the
  corresponding portion of the image will be displayed.
  The dimensions of the images should match the DVD resolution, that
  is, 720x576 for PAL or 720x480 for NTSC.
<P>
  spumux has a feature to autodetect buttons in the image.
  This is a control file that uses it:
</P>
<PRE>
  &lt;subpictures>
    &lt;stream>
      &lt;spu force="yes"
           image="menu2i.png" highlight="menu2h.png" select="menu2s.png"
           autooutline="infer" outlinewidth="6" autoorder="rows">
      &lt;/spu>
    &lt;/stream>
  &lt;/subpictures>
</PRE>
<P>
  <TT>force="yes"</TT> must always be specified because, technically,
  the buttons are implemented as subtitles.
  DVD players let you choose whether to display subtitles or not.
  The <TT>force</TT> attribute overrides that and tells the player to
  always display the buttons, otherwise the menu would not function
  correctly.
<P>
  The three attributes <TT>image</TT>, <TT>highlight</TT>
  and <TT>select</TT> specify the names of the three images that
  define the buttons appearance, as described above (<TT>image</TT>
  defines the default appearance).
<P>
  The other attributes tell spumux to autodetect the buttons.
  It does so by inspecting the three images and looking for matching
  rectangular areas surrounded by a transparent outline at least 6
  pixels wide (that's specified by the <TT>outlinewidth</TT>
  attribute).
  An outline of suitable width is necessary if the button image is a
  string of text, otherwise spumux may identify every letter as a
  distinct button.
  Finally, the <TT>autoorder</TT> attribute specifies how to sort the
  buttons: by rows of by columns.
  You'll need to know the button ordering when you associate an action
  to each of them -- we'll see that in the next examples.
<P>
  The autodetect feature is quite handy but, being a control freak, I
  prefer to specify the buttons positions explicitly.
  This is how to do that:
</P>
<PRE>
  &lt;subpictures>
    &lt;stream>
      &lt;spu force="yes"
           image="menu2i.png" highlight="menu2h.png" select="menu2s.png">
	&lt;button x0="0" y0="440" x1="720" y1="504" />
      &lt;/spu>
    &lt;/stream>
  &lt;/subpictures>
</PRE>
<P>
  A single button is defined here.
  The <TT>x0</TT>, <TT>y0</TT>, <TT>x1</TT> and <TT>y1</TT> attributes
  set the coordinates of the button box.
  I find it convenient to specify a larger rectangle than the actual
  button image: this facilitates pointing the mouse at it when playing
  the DVD on your computer.
  In particular, this button takes the entire width of the DVD screen
  (720 pixels).
  Of course it's up to you to follow that or not.
<P>
  To define more buttons, use multiple <TT>&lt;button></TT> tags:
</P>
<PRE>
  &lt;subpictures>
    &lt;stream>
      &lt;spu force="yes"
           image="menu3i.png" highlight="menu3h.png" select="menu3s.png">
	&lt;button x0="0" y0="258" x1="720" y1="312" />
	&lt;button x0="0" y0="312" x1="720" y1="376" />
	&lt;button x0="0" y0="376" x1="720" y1="440" />
	&lt;button x0="0" y0="440" x1="720" y1="504" />
      &lt;/spu>
    &lt;/stream>
  &lt;/subpictures>
</PRE>
<P>
  The latter two control files were used to create the
  files <TT>menu2.mpg</TT> and <TT>menu3.mpg</TT> that are used in the
  following examples.
  You can run the corresponding DVDs to see how the result looks
  like.
<P>
  There is a severe limitation on the number of colors of the button
  images: you can use only up to four (transparent background
  included).
  I am not sure whether this is dictated by the DVD specification or
  is a deficiency of spumux.
<P>
  Anyway, that requires that if your buttons include written text, it
  must <EM>not</EM> be rendered with font antialiasing.
  That is a technique by which pixels on the edges of each letter are
  blended with the background color in order to make the letter look
  smoother.
  Most text fonts are designed to be used with antialiasing.
  But if you use that, the blended pixels will have different colors
  (potentially each pixel might have a different blend) and thus you
  are almost sure to run out of the 4-colors limit.
  (To be exact, if the background is transparent, what's different is
  actually the pixel's alpha value, while the RGB values are equal.
  But that still counts as different colors.)
<P>
  When you create the button images, you can tell the program you're
  using (e.g., <A HREF="https://www.gimp.org/">the GIMP</A>) to use
  non-antialiased text, but when I tried that, I wasn't satisfied by
  the result: especially if the menu screen contains other text, the
  difference is very noticeable and aesthetically unpleasant.
  (There is also an issue with subtitle scaling with my DVD player
  that makes it even worse.)
  So, for my own DVDs and in the examples of this HOWTO, I chose to
  insert all text into the background image and to use as "button
  image" a colored box that frames the text.
  You may prefer a different solution.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="example7">Example 7</A></H3>
<P>
  Having added one or more buttons to the menu video file with spumux,
  you can specify the action associated to each button by inserting
  a <TT>&lt;button></TT> tag into the <TT>&lt;menus></TT> tag:

  In this example a single button is defined (thus it will always be
  shown as highlighted), and the track will be played when you press
  it.
  Note how, different from the previous examples,
  the <TT>&lt;post></TT> action is to jump back to the menu; that is,
  the menu will be played in a loop until you press the button.

    &lt;/titleset>
  &lt;/dvdauthor>
</PRE>
<P>
  Note how the second <TT>&lt;post></TT> tag does not go back to the
  menu, like the previous examples did, but restarts the title.
  That is, the clock will keep ticking until you stop it.
<P>
  When you play this DVD on your reader, you'll see that when the menu
  video ends, it is restarted, but the currently active button is
  reset.
  For this reason, the menu video should have a sufficient length to
  give the user enough time to select an entry with ease.
  For a simple menu like this, I think 30 seconds should be adequate,
  so this is what I did.
  Your mileage may vary.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="example9">Example 9</A></H3>

  In this example we define two menus, a main menu and a titleset
